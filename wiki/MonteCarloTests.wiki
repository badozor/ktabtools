= Motivation =
 * presentation of RV test
 * graphical representation
 * RV sum (global test)

= Association between two configuration =

RV test
graphical representation (pairwise?)
define the class 'corktab'
(summary.corktab, plot.corktab)

= Global tests =

3 statistics:
 * sum of RVs
 * first eigenvalue of interstructure
 * squared first eigenvalues of interstructure
